# activiti-rest-undertow
Activiti Rest with Undertow.

This is a simple example of adding the Activiti Rest functionality to your own application using
the Undertow Servlet container as the backend.

The Activiti configuration can be customized in the src/main/resources/spring/app.properties. By default,
it will use an embedded H2 Database.
